            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to build a responsive web app for an online store, with the goal of creating an easy and convenient shopping experience for its user. My role in this project was branding, UI/UX Design, and prototyping.
            </p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>The design process began by defining the brand and establishing design guidelines to ensure that the look of the product would be consistent with our brand identity.</p>
            <p>The brand, Jane Street, was inspired by the old city-streets of New York - think tree-lined blocks, cobblestones, and timeless brick facades. Design meant to withstand the test of time. Coupled with that is the driving principle that
              everyone has the right to quality clothing. The Jane Street aim is to provide timeless design that doesn’t break the bank. With Jane Street, customers can form the building blocks of their wardrobe and enjoy their closet for years to
              come.</p>
            <picture>

          <div class="">
            <p>The typography used at Jane Street is representative of the brand: classic but unfussy. The Maitree font, meaning “friendliness” in Thai, is traditional yet approachable. This font is used in the Jane Street logo and headings. The
              Prompt logo uses wide proportions for easy readability, and at the same time, lends an elegant yet casual feel. This font is used in body copy.</p>

          <div class="">
            <p>The colors of Jane Street were kept simple, while still reflecting on our inspiration of the old city-streets of New York. We started with a clean palette of white and black to showcase the merchandise, and added accents of brick red
              and ivy green.</p>

            <p>The photography used for the Jane Street brand aims for a simple look with a light and airy feel. The focus remains on the product and the customer wearing it. Photos include solid or non-distracting backgrounds, serene expressions,
              and close-up shots of the clothing.</p>

          <div class="">
            <p>Jane Street communicates to its customers like trusted colleagues, and indeed, that’s the relationship the brand strives to foster. The aim is to be professional, never pretentious; empowering, never exclusionary. The Jane Street goal
              is to help customers build a closet that they’ll love.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <p>With a brand identity in mind, I selected key requirements for my project:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>allow customers to access inventory without having to register, so they can view products before having to create an account.</li>
              <li>ability to place multiple items in a shopping cart, so the customer can purchase more than one item at a time.</li>
              <li>let customers save items to a wish list, so they can be purchased at a later date.</li>
              <li>advanced filtering options, so the customer doesn’t have to browse through a lot of products to find what they’re looking for.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <p>These key requirements were combined to create a userflow diagram:</p>

          <div class="">
            <h3>Wireframing</h3>
            <p>After developing the userflow diagram, I began the process of sketching wireframes for my product. Being familiar with online e-commerce sites, I wanted to keep features and patterns consistent with other online stores so that the app
              would feel familiar for my user. Once that was done, I digitized the designs into mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>

          <div class="">
            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <p>After putting together the mid-fidelity wireframes, it was time to put my designs to the test. I developed an interactive prototype to ensure that users would be able to navigate my app easily. This test would also help to identify any
              pain points we’d need to correct before developing our final design.</p>

            <h3>User Testing and Analysis</h3>
            <div class="">
              <p>User #1 - Alica</p>
              <p>“I love your menu and how you placed it in the middle! It looks clear and simple, the way it should be.”</p>
              <p>“I was going easily through the whole process but then got confused at the very end - order confirmation wasn't clear to me, the buttons My Orders and Keep Shopping sort of overrode it. I clicked to Keep Shopping, looking for my
                order
                payment now/where it has ended.“</p>
            </div>
            <div class="">
              <p>User #2 - Ryan</p>
              <p>“I think it’s really straightforward and intuitive. It’s a crazy feeling to go through the buying process without knowing what you’re buying without the images! But it says a lot about your design, being able to get through it flying
                blind.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="">
              <p>User #3 - Celina</p>
              <p>“Very straightforward!”</p>
              <p>“I like that there is an option to checkout as a guest. It can be annoying sometimes when sites/apps make you create accounts to purchase products.”</p>
              <p>“The checkout process was very intuitive and detailed (in terms of getting the user information and payment details) without being too busy.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="">
              <p>User #4 - Erin</p>
              <p>“Very straightforward shopping basket. For the checkout, it may be helpful to have a progress bar on top, or segmented navigation, so the user can go back to edit shipping, payment info, etc.”</p>
              <p>“Does the search on the top bar work for each page? It would be great to have the ability to search for the style, color etc. Right away that’s the first thing I want to do when browsing clothing.”</p>

              <h3>Final Design</h3>
              <p>As a result of user testing, I made minor adjustments to my wireframes, allowing for navigation in-between purchase stages, and changing the purchase confirmation from a pop-up to a standalone screen. I also added wireframes to show
                the filter and search functions, and improved the overall text hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>When it came to putting together this online shopping site, it was best to follow the familiar pattern and flows that I was used to seeing in other e-commerce sites. This resulted in a relatively successful user test, in that my
              participants found the experience very straightforward and intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>Even though it was best to follow convention, the brand guideline elements were where I could add more expressive design and give my product its own identity. Making deliberate choices in typography, color, imagery, and writing style
              allowed me to give my product a distinct personality.
            </p>
            <p>In a future iteration, it would be useful to be able to adjust the size of the items on view, and the number of items on one page. This will allow the user to get a closer look at individual clothing items (if viewing fewer and larger
              items per page), or see many items at once (if viewing more, smaller items per page).
